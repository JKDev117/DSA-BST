/*9. Are they the same BSTs?
You are given two arrays which represent two sequences of keys that are used to create two binary search trees. 

Write a program that will tell whether the two BSTs will be identical or not without actually constructing the tree. 


You may use another data structure such as an array or a linked list but don't construct the BST. What is the time complexity of your algorithm? 

E.g., 3, 5, 4, 6, 1, 0, 2 and 3, 1, 5, 2, 4, 6, 0 are two sequences of arrays but will create the exact same BSTs and your program should return true.
